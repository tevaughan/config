Configuration for vim, bash, and other programs.

This repository contains configuration files in a structure that is relative to
a user's home directory in a unix environment.

Each file here may be pointed to by logical link from the corresponding
location in the home directory.

A file that in the home directory is hidden by a leading dot in the name does
*not*, however, have a leading dot here in the repository.
